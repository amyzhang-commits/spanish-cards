SPANISH VERB TRAINER - MOBILE PWA ENHANCEMENT ROADMAP
========================================================

## Current Status
✅ Core PWA foundation built (manifest.json, service worker, responsive CSS)
✅ Offline-first architecture with IndexedDB storage
✅ Full functionality works on mobile browsers
✅ Cross-device sync infrastructure ready

## Next Phase: True Mobile App Experience

### 1. INSTALL PROMPT & APP-LIKE BEHAVIOR
- [ ] Add "Install App" button with native browser install prompt
- [ ] Hide browser UI when installed (standalone display mode)
- [ ] Add app launch splash screen
- [ ] Implement "beforeinstallprompt" event handling

### 2. MOBILE UX OPTIMIZATIONS
- [ ] Larger touch targets (minimum 44px for iOS guidelines)
- [ ] Swipe gestures for flashcards (swipe to reveal, swipe for next)
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh on card lists
- [ ] Better mobile keyboard handling for text inputs
- [ ] Haptic feedback for interactions (if supported)

### 3. NATIVE-LIKE FEATURES
- [ ] Background sync when app reopens
- [ ] Push notifications for study reminders (optional)
- [ ] Share target (share sentences from other apps)
- [ ] Offline indicator with better mobile styling
- [ ] App shortcuts (quick actions from home screen)

### 4. PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENTS
- [ ] Lazy loading for large card sets
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for manage cards view
- [ ] Image compression for any future image features
- [ ] Bundle optimization for faster initial load

### 5. MOBILE-SPECIFIC STUDY FEATURES
- [ ] Voice recording for pronunciation practice
- [ ] Camera integration for text extraction (future)
- [ ] One-handed study mode
- [ ] Shake to shuffle cards
- [ ] Study streak tracking with local notifications

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Install Prompt Implementation
```javascript
// Add to main app.js
let deferredPrompt;
window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  deferredPrompt = e;
  showInstallButton();
});
```

### Mobile Gestures
```javascript
// Add to study.js for swipe navigation
let startX, startY;
flashcard.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => {
  startX = e.touches[0].clientX;
  startY = e.touches[0].clientY;
});
```

### Service Worker Enhancements
- Add background sync for offline card creation
- Cache management for optimal performance
- Update notification system

## Core Philosophy Alignment
This roadmap maintains the local-first, cloud-sync philosophy:
- **Primary storage:** IndexedDB (works 100% offline)
- **Secondary storage:** Railway for cross-device sync
- **Offline capability:** Full functionality without internet
- **Mobile-first:** Native app experience without app store

## Success Metrics
- App can be installed from home screen
- Feels indistinguishable from native app
- Study sessions work seamlessly offline
- Cross-device sync happens transparently
- Load time under 2 seconds on mobile

## Target User Experience
"I install the Spanish Verb Trainer from my browser to my phone's home screen. It opens instantly like any native app. I can study my cards on the subway with no internet, create new verb sets during a flight, and everything syncs perfectly when I get back online. It feels as smooth and responsive as Anki."

## Implementation Priority
1. Install prompt (highest impact, lowest effort)
2. Mobile touch optimizations
3. Swipe gestures for study mode
4. Background sync improvements
5. Advanced mobile features (voice, etc.)

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1 (Install + Basic Mobile): 1-2 sessions
- Phase 2 (Advanced UX): 2-3 sessions
- Phase 3 (Native Features): 2-3 sessions

TOTAL: Ready for app store-quality experience in ~6 development sessions
